<span> Element
<span></span>, like div is a container but this time <span> is a inline elmenet;
The <span> HTML element is a generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not inherently represent anything.

<!--
<br> Element
The <br> HTML element produces a line break in text (carriage-return).
It is useful for writing a poem or an address,
where the division of lines is significant.

    The birds are asleep in the trees:<br>
    Wait, soon like these<br>
    Thou too shalt rest.

<sup> SuperScript / <sub> SubScript

Superscripts are usually rendered with a raised baseline using smaller text.
