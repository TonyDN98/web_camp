Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and younger male      may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An      adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called      a pullet.    </p>    <p>      Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia,      Southeast Asia, and East Asia,[5] but the clade found in the Americas,      Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian      subcontinent.    </p>    <h2>Terminology</h2>    <p>      An adult male is a called a 'cock' or 'rooster' (in the United States) and      an adult female is called a 'hen'.[1    </p>    <p>      Lorem ipsum, dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.
